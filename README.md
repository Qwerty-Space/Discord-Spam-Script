## Using this script to attack a server won't work because it sends too slowly, so don't bother

### What does it do?
This script will send 9 messages every 8 milliseconds, then wait 5 seconds and start again.  

### How do I make it say something else?
Change `:smiley:` to something else.  Open an issue, or PM me on Discord/Telegram if you know me on there and would like some help.

### How do I use it?
Download either the script (AHK) or the executable (found in releases) and double click to run.  Press F4 (configurable) to toggle.

### Dependencies
Requires AutoHotkey and a brain  
None, if you run the executable file (found in releases)
